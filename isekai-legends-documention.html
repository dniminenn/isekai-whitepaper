This guide will provide you with an overview of the project, including its tokenomics, waifus, adventurers’ guilds, reward distribution mechanisms, and referral system. You’ll also find information on the ERC1155 staking contract (<em>Adventure Party</em>) that powers the Isekai Legends platform.</p><p>Isekai Legends is a decentralized platform that offers an engaging and rewarding experience for users who love anime and NFTs. The platform features two types of waifus (Unique and Seasonal) that users can collect and use to participate in various activities, such as staking their waifus’ power levels to earn $ISEKAI tokens in the Adventurers’ Guilds.</p><p>Get ready to embark on a thrilling journey into the world of Isekai Legends!</p><h2 id="tokenomics">Tokenomics</h2><p>100% (69T) allocated for liquidity</p><p>0% dev allocation</p><p>The Isekai token ($ISEKAI) serves as the core currency in the Isekai Legends ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Funding Protocol Development</strong> A small percentage (1%) of the tax collected from $ISEKAI token transactions is allocated to fund the ongoing development of the Isekai Legends protocol. This ensures that the dApp continues to evolve.</p><p><strong>Autobuy Isekai Token with Mint Proceeds</strong> To maintain a sustainable reward system, the mint proceeds from both unique and seasonal waifus are programmatically set to autobuy $ISEKAI tokens. These tokens are then used to fund the next round of rewards for the Order of Legendaries and Seasonal Enclave guilds, creating a robust and self-sustaining economy within the Isekai Legends ecosystem.</p><p>By integrating the Isekai token into various aspects of the dApp, Isekai Legends ensures that its in-game currency plays a pivotal role in facilitating player engagement and supporting the overall growth of the platform.</p><h3 id="tax-mechanism">Tax Mechanism</h3><p>A adjustable tax mechanism is in place for $ISEKAI token transactions, with the exception of sells to our QuickSwap LP. This tax is utilized to fund the farming rewards for each season, ensuring a continuous flow of rewards. The <em>$ISEKAI tax is 10%</em> at protocol launch. This tax is combined with the mint proceeds from the previous season to fund the next season of rewards.</p><h3 id="token-utilities">Token Utilities</h3><p>$ISEKAI tokens have multiple utilities within the platform:</p><ul><li><strong>Staking:</strong> Users can stake their waifus’ power levels (ERC1155 tokens) in the Adventurers’ Guilds to earn $ISEKAI tokens as rewards.</li><li><strong>Referral Rewards:</strong> Users who refer others to mint Seasonal Waifus can earn a <em>5% kickback</em> in $ISEKAI tokens.</li></ul><h3 id="planned-utilities">Planned Utilities</h3><ul><li><strong>Minting:</strong> In future seasons, users will be able mint Seasonal Waifus using $ISEKAI tokens directly once the initial volatility subsides.</li></ul><p>By offering multiple utilities and a capped supply, the $ISEKAI token is designed to provide long-term value and utility within the Isekai Legends ecosystem.</p><h2 id="waifus">Waifus</h2><p>In Isekai Legends, Waifus are the central characters that players collect, treasure, and utilize for various in-game activities. Waifus are divided into two main categories: Unique Waifus and Seasonal Waifus. Each category offers distinct features and rarities that cater to different preferences and play styles. Before staking, Waifus must be wrapped into a party, forming their combined “Party Power Levels.”</p><h3 id="unique-waifus">Unique Waifus</h3><p>Unique Waifus are rare and highly sought-after characters with a limited supply. They boast a strong collectible value and are prized possessions among players. Unique Waifus are available in two rarities, each with their own farming power multiplier:</p><ul><li><strong>Epic:</strong> Exceptionally powerful and rare characters with a 1500x farming power multiplier.</li><li><strong>Legendary:</strong> The pinnacle of rarity and power in the Isekai Legends universe with a 3000x farming power multiplier.</li></ul><h3 id="seasonal-waifus">Seasonal Waifus</h3><p>Seasonal Waifus are characters minted during specific seasons through a gacha-style mystery box system. The price for minting Seasonal Waifus is 10 MATIC, which may change in subsequent seasons. Seasonal Waifus offer a variety of rarities, allowing players to collect and treasure a diverse range of characters. Each rarity has its own farming power multiplier:</p><ul><li><strong>Common:</strong> 1x farming power multiplier.</li><li><strong>Uncommon:</strong> 5x farming power multiplier.</li><li><strong>Rare:</strong> 20x farming power multiplier.</li><li><strong>Epic:</strong> 100x farming power multiplier.</li><li><strong>Legendary:</strong> 1500x farming power multiplier.</li></ul><p>The higher the rarity of a Seasonal Waifu, the greater the farming power multiplier, allowing players to earn more rewards when staking them in the Seasonal Enclave Adventurers’ Guild.</p><h2 id="adventurers-guilds">Adventurers’ Guilds</h2><p>Isekai Legends features two distinguished Adventurers’ Guilds that players can join to stake their wrapped Waifu parties’ Party Power Levels and earn $ISEKAI tokens as rewards. Staking your Party Power Levels into the guilds is akin to “sending your Waifus on an adventure.” The guilds cater to the different Waifu categories, providing a tailored experience for players based on their collections.</p><h3 id="order-of-legendaries">Order of Legendaries</h3><p>The Order of Legendaries is an esteemed society that caters exclusively to players who hold Unique Waifus. By staking their Party Power Levels comprised of Unique Waifus, players gain access to a prestigious and rewarding experience. The Order of Legendaries receives a portion of the protocol income, which is allocated to reward its members.</p><h3 id="seasonal-enclave">Seasonal Enclave</h3><p>The Seasonal Enclave is a vibrant and ever-changing community tailored for players with Seasonal Waifus. As players stake their Party Power Levels comprised of Seasonal Waifus, they can earn a share of the protocol income allocated for the Seasonal Enclave. The Enclave offers a dynamic and engaging experience, with rewards and opportunities evolving with each season.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 12, 2023</p></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Protocol Documentation</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://docs.isekailegends.com/index.html#introduction" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.isekailegends.com/index.html#tokenomics" target="_self">Tokenomics</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.isekailegends.com/index.html#waifus" target="_self">Waifus</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.isekailegends.com/index.html#introduction">Adventurers&#x27; Guilds</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.isekailegends.com/index.html#reward-distribution-mechanism" target="_self">Rewards Distribution</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.isekailegends.com/index.html#referral-system" target="_self">Refer a friend!</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Have a question, suggestion, or just want to connect?
